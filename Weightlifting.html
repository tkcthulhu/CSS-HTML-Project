    <p>My hobby that keeps me in shape is olympic weightlifting. This particular hobby is the most recent out of all of them, I have been at this one only about 2 years, but I have always had some variety of physical activity in my life. Before weightlifting it was crossfit, 
    before that it was rock climbing, before that it was MMA, before that it was rock climbing again (Another hobby I do still have, but more importantly... I still have all the GEAR), and so on and so forth. Weightlifting has stuck though because of its flexibility in my 
    life, and the straight forward training. Once again though, you can always stretch more, your diet can be better, you can do one more rep, you can review that video gain, your weight should be more forward, brace your core, hold your shoulders tighter, theres literally no end
     to the possibilities of things you can work on to improve your technique! Even though it can get frustrating and make you want to quit, staying and persevering always pays off.
