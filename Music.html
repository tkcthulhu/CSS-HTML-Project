    <h2>Music<br>The Ever Expanding Collection of Gear and Scales</h2>

    <p>My hobby that keeps me creative is music. So I have been playing piano since I was about 4, I had lessons all growing up and when I'm in practice I am a pretty decent pianist, that love then led to me picking up other instruments.
     When I was 10 I started percussion in band at my middle school, I played all throughout middle and highschool, and after that I was involved in some various drum groups (Which I of course needed drums and other percussion equipment for)
     I have been playing guitar since I was about 12 years old, I started out with a Squier Stratocaster and a Roland Micro Cube amp. I had lessons for a few years and have played in a good number of bands and jam groups, guitar was the first time though
     that I really started to get the bug for the hunt and aquisition of gear. Suddenly I needed 5 different amps, 6 guitars, 3 keyboards, a drum set, frum pad, audio interfaces, microphones, a DAW... Oh no now I have to learn how to use the DAW, how to mix my
     recordings, how to set up my recording equipment, how to dial in my amps, how to create synth tones, how to program my drumpads, how to properly mic up and dial in an acoustic vs. an electric guitar, not to mention on top of all of this I still
     have to actually practice the actual instruments themselves, scales, rythyms, techniques, styles, improvistion, it never ends, but I still love it.</p>

        <p>Let's go through some of this equipment:
            <ul>
                <li>1) This is my drum pad and one of my various usb interfaces, I'm a big fan of this one becasue it can handle standard and condenser mics as well as direct guitar input if I want to use modeling software.<br><img src="images/drum-pad-interface.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>2) This one is a book on modifying Fender tube amplifiers, I have a Hotrod Deluxe that is not pictured since it is at a friends house, however all the mods I have done to it are from this book.<br><img src="images/Amp-book.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>3) This is probably my favorite amp I own, the mighty Vox AC4TV, it is a 4 watt version of its big brothers, the AC15 and AC30, which are 2 of the most famous british rock amps behind Marshall<br><img src="images/Vox.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>4) One of my various musical history books, a very abbreviated history of rock and roll, but still very interesting!<br><img src="images/Rock-book.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>5) A lovely showcase of the various guitars I have stashed all over the house, theres some pretty cool stuff in these cases!<br><img src="images/guitar-cases.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>6) My prized 1994 Les Paul Standard, I actually got this thing with a broken headstock for a bargain with the intention of fixing it, however it turned out to be significantly above my paygrade so to speak, 
                    I ended up taking it to RS Guitarworks in Winchester and they got her perfect for me!<br><img src="images/Les-paul-more-paul.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>7) This is my first guitar that I got for Christmas when I was 12, very interesting story about this one. I actually traded it away in highschool and spent quite a while trying to hunt it back down, I ended up
                    finding it in the used section at guitar center several years later and literally bought it on the spot, it stays in the regular rotation.<br><img src="images/First-guitar.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>8) One of my guitar reference books, this has almost every guitar made in the United States in history, very intersting to flip through!<br><img src="images/guitar-history-book.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>9) The current project I'm working on, I've been piecing this one together for a few years now, excited to see it finally come together!<br><img src="images/guitar-parts.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>10) A classical guitar I actually found on the side of the road, it just looked so helpless, I'll get her fixed up!<br><img src="images/classical-guitar.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>11) This box is straight up full of sheet music, not ever kidding this thing weights almost 30lbs.<br><img src="images/Sheet-music.jpeg" height="504" width="378"></li>
                <li>12) My keyboard, it has full weighted keys and has been with me since college. Still to this day one of the favorites to sit and twiddle away on!<br><img src="images/keyboard.jpeg" height="378" width="504"></li>
                <li>13) This is jsut a cheap MIDI keyboard I picked up off FB Marketplace, honestly my son plays with this one more than I do...<br><img src="images/keyboard(2).jpeg" height="378" width="504"></li>
                <li>14) Finally the glorious scale and chord books, if I'm practicing technical exercises it's out of one of these books, they can be pretty dry but the information is spectacular!<br><img src="images/guitar-books.jpeg" height="378" width="504"></li>
            </ul>
