    <h1>My Destructive Hobby Habit</h1>

    <p>So I have a belief that every one needs 3 hobbies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One that keeps you healthy</li>
            <li>One that keeps you creative</li>
            <li>One that keeps your mind sharp</li>
        </ul>
    <p>This is all very well and good, but there's a problem, having three hobbies doesn't seem like it would be that big of a deal right? However I now introduce you to the concept of...<em>*drumroll*</em></p>
    <p><strong>The Sub-Hobby</strong>.</p> 
    <p>Let me explain...</p>
    <p>Whenever you have a hobby, there are always going to be extra things that you have to do in order to make the most of your investment in sed hobby, or things that you do in order to make it ever more enjoyable. <br> </p>
