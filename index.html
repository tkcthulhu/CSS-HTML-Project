    <h1>My Destructive Hobby Habit</h1>

    <p>So I have a belief that every one needs 3 hobbies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>one that keeps you healthy</li>
            <li>one that keeps you creative</li>
            <li>one that keeps your mind sharp</li>
        </ul>
    <p>This is all very well and good, but there's a problem, having three hobbies doesn't seem like it would be that big of a deal right? However I now introduce you to the concept of the <strong>Sub-Hobby</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Item <span>one</span></li>
        <li>Item two</li>
        <li>Item <em>three</em></li>
    </ul>

</body>
